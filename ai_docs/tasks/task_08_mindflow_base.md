# Task 08: MindFlow Orchestrator Node in LangGraph (Prompt)

## Objective
Implement MindFlow as the orchestrator node in LangGraph, coordinating other agent nodes and using tools for proactivity, scheduling, and intelligent suggestions.

## Deliverables
- MindFlow node implemented in Python (agents/mindflow.py)
- Coordinates TaskFlow, CalendarFlow, InfoFlow via the graph
- Uses tools for scheduling and suggestions
- Node registered as orchestrator in the LangGraph graph
- Changes committed to version control

## Steps
1. Create `agents/mindflow.py` with a class or function for the MindFlow node:
   ```python
   # agents/mindflow.py
   from agents.taskflow import taskflow_node
   from agents.calendarflow import calendarflow_node
   from agents.infoflow import infoflow_node
   from tools.scheduler_tool import find_free_slots, propose_schedule

   def mindflow_node(input, context):
       # Example: proactive scan logic
       urgent_tasks = ... # call db_tool to get urgent tasks
       free_slots = find_free_slots(...)
       for task in urgent_tasks:
           for slot in free_slots:
               if slot['duration'] >= task['estimated_time']:
                   propose_schedule(task, slot)
                   # Optionally, call calendarflow_node or taskflow_node
       return "Proactive suggestions sent."
   ```
2. In your main LangGraph setup, register the node:
   ```python
   from agents.mindflow import mindflow_node
   graph.add_node('MindFlow', mindflow_node)
   # Optionally, set as orchestrator or entry point
   ```
3. Ensure MindFlow can coordinate other nodes and tools.
4. Test MindFlow node independently and as part of the graph.
5. Add and commit the changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Implement MindFlow orchestrator node in LangGraph"
   ```

**At the end of this step, run:**
```bash
git push
```
to update the repository.
