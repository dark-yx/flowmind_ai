### **2\. Technical Architecture and Exclusive Hackathon Resources (MVP)**

FlowMind AI's architecture is designed to be **lean, efficient, and entirely native to Bolt.new**, minimizing the need for explicit code and maximizing the platform's capabilities.

#### **2.1. Core Components with Bolt.new**

* **User Interface (Frontend):** This will be generated entirely through **natural language prompts in Bolt.new**.  
  * **Unified Dashboard:** A clean, intuitive interface that consolidates tasks, calendar events, quick notes, and an "agent activity summary."  
  * **Central Conversational Chat:** The core interaction point for users with FlowMind AI. All agent inputs and outputs will be managed through this chat interface, leveraging Bolt.new's natural language processing capabilities.  
  * **Simplified Status Section:** A visually discreet area showing "active" or "available" agents, without complex real-time monitoring.  
  * **Minimalist & Intuitive Design:** The aesthetic will be achieved through design prompts directed at Bolt.new, focusing on simplicity, readability, and a frictionless user experience. Bolt.new will handle responsiveness automatically.  
* **Backend and Data Persistence:** Managed by **Bolt.new and its native integration with PostgreSQL (via Prisma)**.  
  * **Relational Database:** The database schema will be defined by prompts in Bolt.new, including tables for:  
    * tasks (fields: id, name, description, due\_date, priority, status, user\_id).  
    * events (fields: id, title, start\_date, end\_date, location, user\_id).  
    * notes (fields: id, content, creation\_date, user\_id).  
  * **Internal APIs:** Bolt.new will automatically generate RESTful APIs to interact with these database tables, allowing our "agents" (defined by prompts) to perform CRUD operations without explicit code.

#### **2.2. Multi-Agent System Compatible with Multiple Models (MVP)**

The key innovation lies in our **efficient, low-code multi-agent system**, managed entirely within the Bolt.new environment.

* **Agent Definition via Prompts:** In the MVP, "agents" will not be independent code microservices, but rather **logical functions orchestrated by advanced prompts within Bolt.new**. Each agent will have a clear role:  
  * **TaskFlow Agent:** Manages task creation, updates, prioritization, and deletion. *Prompt example:* "When the user says 'add task \[task name\] for \[date\]', create an entry in the 'tasks' table with that name and date, and a 'pending' status."  
  * **CalendarFlow Agent:** Interacts with the user's calendar. *Prompt example:* "When the user says 'what do I have tomorrow?', query the 'events' table for events occurring the next day."  
  * **InfoFlow Agent:** Processes basic information requests. *Prompt example:* "When the user asks 'summarize tech news', search and briefly summarize \[using Bolt.new's LLM capability\] the latest technology news."  
  * **MindFlow Agent (Proactive Orchestrator):** This is the "brain." Its logic will be implemented through **complex, conditional prompts within Bolt.new**. It will analyze data from tasks and the calendar, and chat interactions, to generate **proactive suggestions and automate simple workflows**. *Example prompt for proactivity:* "If there's a high-priority task with an upcoming due date and the calendar has a free block, suggest to the user: 'Do you want to use your free time to work on \[task name\]?'"  
* **Dynamic AI Model Management:**  
  * **Centralized Flexibility in Bolt.new:** Bolt.new's ability to consume external APIs will be key. A **simple configuration** (e.g., an entry in a llm\_config table in the database or an environment variable managed in Bolt.new) will be designed to specify the **API endpoint and key for the preferred AI model** (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude).  
  * **Dynamic Switching:** When the MindFlow Agent needs to perform an LLM operation (e.g., a summary or text generation), the API request will be dynamically constructed using the endpoint and key of the active model from the configuration. This **will not require changes to code files**, but rather the modification of a value in the configuration that Bolt.new will interpret to route the calls.

#### **2.3. Authentication and API Access with Gmail**

* **Google (Gmail) Login:** We will use the **OAuth 2.0 functionality that Bolt.new facilitates** for Google login. This will provide a familiar and secure user experience, without requiring custom authentication code.  
* **Automated API Identification:** Once the user logs in with their Gmail account, FlowMind AI (through predefined configuration in Bolt.new) will request the **necessary permissions to access the user's Google Calendar and Google Tasks APIs**. This will be managed declaratively in Bolt.new, allowing the CalendarFlow and TaskFlow agents to directly interact with the user's Google data, making the system significantly more powerful and proactive. This integration will be achieved using Bolt.new's capabilities for Google service connectors, without the need to write code files for authentication or token handling.

### **3\. Integration with Challenge Technologies (Efficiency and Low-Code)**

To maximize our chances of winning challenge prizes, we will strategically integrate the following technologies, maintaining the **minimum code** and high-efficiency philosophy that Bolt.new enables:

* **Deploy Challenge: Netlify**  
  * **Implementation:** Bolt.new facilitates direct deployment to Netlify for full-stack applications. Our process will be limited to **connecting Bolt.new with our Netlify account**, and deployment will be automated after each update, ensuring efficient and continuous implementation. No additional code will be required.  
* **Startup Challenge: Supabase**  
  * **Implementation:** While Bolt.new uses PostgreSQL and Prisma internally, to meet the challenge and demonstrate scalability, we will configure **Supabase as our database for user and role management**. Bolt.new allows connection to external databases. This will be achieved with a **connection configuration in Bolt.new** and the **declarative migration of the user schema** to Supabase, without writing complex code files for the ORM or migrations. Task and event logic could remain in Bolt.new's internal database for the MVP, while Supabase handles authentication and user profiles at scale.  
* **Voice AI Challenge: ElevenLabs**  
  * **Implementation:** To make FlowMind AI conversational by voice, we will use the **ElevenLabs API** for speech synthesis (Text-to-Speech) and speech recognition (Speech-to-Text).  
  * **Low-Code Approach:** In Bolt.new's chat interface, simple "speak" and "listen" buttons will be integrated. Pressing "speak" will send microphone audio to ElevenLabs' Speech-to-Text API. The transcription will be injected into the chat field as user input. Agent responses (generated by Bolt.new) will be sent to ElevenLabs' Text-to-Speech API, and the resulting audio will be played to the user. This will be achieved through **ElevenLabs API calls configured in Bolt.new**, possibly using Bolt.new's pre-built components for audio handling or with a minimal amount of JavaScript code inserted directly into the generated interface, if Bolt.new allows it.  
* **Conversational AI Video Challenge: Tavus**  
  * **Implementation:** To incorporate real-time AI video agents, we will ingeniously integrate **Tavus**. Instead of an ever-present video agent, we could implement a "Video Productivity Report" or "Personalized Daily Greeting" functionality.  
  * **Low-Code Approach:** FlowMind AI could generate a daily summary of tasks or proactive suggestions (using its internal agents and LLMs). This text would be sent to the **Tavus API to generate a short video** with a personalized AI avatar that "reads" the summary. The generated video (or a link to it) would be embedded in the user's dashboard. The integration would be done via **Tavus API calls configured in Bolt.new**, triggered by specific events (e.g., clicking a "Generate Video Report" button) or scheduled.  
* **Make More Money Challenge: RevenueCat mobile SDK and RevenueCat Paywall Builder**  
  * **Consideration:** This challenge focuses on "mobile Bolt.new apps." Since our primary MVP is a **web application**, direct compliance with the "RevenueCat mobile SDK" might be a challenge without significantly deviating from the core web strategy.  
  * **Strategy for MVP (Web):** If Bolt.new allows for rapid implementation of a PWA (Progressive Web App) or if there's a way to use RevenueCat to manage web app subscriptions in a simplified manner, we could implement a **"premium plan" for FlowMind AI** that unlocks advanced features (e.g., more proactive agents, extended history). The "paywall" would be built with basic UI components in Bolt.new, and the subscription logic would be managed through **RevenueCat API calls (if compatible with web or if there's a light web SDK)**. Otherwise, we will prioritize the other challenges that are more directly aligned with the web nature of Bolt.new.
